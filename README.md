Hey everyone, welcome to the LIC_WebDesk .
Basically, LIC_WebDesk is a digital platform designed exclusively for LIC agents — a place to showcase their area of expertise, track record, and achievements. It’s all about building trust and credibility with clients through a clean, dynamic, and professional online presence.

The highlight of LIC_WebDesk_Hub is that it’s fully dynamic. You can instantly update content like banners, testimonials, blogs, insurance catalogs, plan details, and even live news — automatically fetched via web scraping from leading news agencies.

🌐 Platform Overview

LIC_WebDesk is built with two main modules:

My Agent Portal (Agent Dashboard)
